# Project-X

# Overview

## Problem statement

1. In reality, the luster of starting a new practice can dissipate sooner than weâ€™d like to admit. We need a system to help make us those little pushes when the going gets tough.
2. Without any accountability, we increase the likelihood of forgetting about our new habits altogether. Having a tracking system helps us stay committed.

## Proposed work

user should be able to track his habbit and an option to encript his habbit as some habbit's are personal. 

A Graph where he can view all his details per habbit level.

# Success criteria

should meet all the requirements

# User stories

## **As a Backend Developer**

- should be able to manage non logged in user
- should be able to do all CRUD operation
- should be able to provide with all the data about the habit fast like batching or something should be used to send large amount of data to user.

## As a user

- I want see all the habit in one single page
- should be able to see all the history about particular habit

## As a mobile app developer

- should take care of feel as user intract with the habbit? like about the vibration and sound.
- The history data should be shown in non clutterd way (simple yet efficient)

# Scope

## Requirements

- user should be able to add/remove habits
- reminder about his habit time (alaram type)
- every habbit must have a start time and end time (per day like 2-3 hours or 1-2 min)
- sound functionality when ever he completes his task in the habbit
- count of his streak
- There should be a 1day skip per week, like a cheat day (streaks will not be affected)
- There should be 3 states on each task: 
1. uncompleted
2. completed
3. could not complete (due to some reason, the streak will not be affected)

## Future work

- adding streak medals
- monetization by restricting the number of habits he can create  default 2 habits and anything above then that will have to pay a monthly subscription fee
- Track Negative/Limit Habits
- Google Calendar Integration
- monetization using Themes (Sprint 3)

## Non-requirements

- Front end development
